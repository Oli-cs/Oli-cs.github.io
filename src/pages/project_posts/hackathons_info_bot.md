# Hackathons <span class="text-gradient">Info Bot</span>

## Initial Idea
I had this idea when running for trips and hackathons secretary of <a href="https://hacksocnotts.co.uk/">Hacksoc</a> at the University of Nottingham. Initially I was only going to include hackathons sponsored by Hackathons UK because they have an API, but after realising that they weren't going to give me access (the API wasn't public) I decided that I would scrape the information I needed off the relevant public webpages

## Development
Coming Soon!
