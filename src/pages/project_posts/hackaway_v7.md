# Mansion <span class="text-gradient">Escape</span>

## Idea
We came up with this idea at the beginning of Hackaway v7, a 24hr hackathon at Royal Holloway University London. Given that our previous strategy of picking a prize category and going for it worked so well, we decided to do it again. The category we picked was "Best use of Taipy" because we wanted to work with new technology. Having chosen to utilise Taipy for our project, we also decided that we wanted to stray from the general purpose of the library. We decided to reimagine its tools to create something unique, that Taipy has not been used for before. We accomplished this goal by building a digital escape room.

## Development
Taipy, as a library based around documentation applications, did not have much support for what we were looking to include in a game. Because of this, we often struggled to include some features of games, for example art or a moving sprite. Despite this, we stuck true to our goal to utilise Taipy in a unique manner, and so focused the narrative of our game around the tools we had available to us.<br/>

This involved repurposing and chaining several elements together, such as having 4 toggle switches to create a puzzle with 15 wrong answers and 1 right one vs only having 1 wrong answer and 1 right answer.
